# List of third-party lists to download and include into generated
# blacklist zone file.
# Please verify the list matches your interest or compile your own!
# 
# Whitelists are applied AFTER all blacklists are compiled together
# which means an entry in the whitelist will finally remove the domain
# from the whole blacklist. Provider order does not matter in this case.
